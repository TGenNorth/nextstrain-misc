This NextStrain build shows SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from COVID-19 cases in Arizona, USA.

Although the genetic relationships among sampled viruses are quite clear in the phylogenetic tree, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding estimates of transmission dates and in reconstruction of geographic spread. Please be aware that specific inferred transmission patterns are only a hypothesis.

Site numbering and genome structure use [hCoV-19/Wuhan/WIV04/2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/1802633808) as reference. Temporal resolution assumes a nucleotide substitution rate of 8 Ã— 10^-4 subs per site per year. Full details on bioinformatic processing can be found [here](https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov).
